# CS-305-SoftwareSecurity
Artemis Financial 

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a financial institution that looking to create security software that will better protect their customers. This security software will help prevent hackers/attackers from accessing customers personal information. It will also make sure that the only people that can access this information are authorized people.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Something that I did good was test for vulnerabilities by running dependency checks. This is where I would be able to look at a list of vulnerabilities found in the code. It is very important to have secure code. Secure code helps prevent hackers/attackers from accessing information not meant for them to see. It also helps people trust your compnay and their security measures. Without secured code, people can have their personal information stolen and that could lead to people leaving and their repution going down.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The one part of the vulnerability assessment that I found helpful fishing out the false-positive. This help find vulnerabilities that maybe weren't actually present. I tested for false-positives a couple of times. And somes times after running the dependency check again, the list of vulnerabilities was smaller.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I create a an SSl certificate and make sure that everything was secure while using hhtps. I would use dependency checks to assess vulnerabilities and using suppression to test for false-positives. 

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I made sure that the code was written correctly. I also tested the code multiple times to make sure that the code worked. I also used dependency checks to to see the list of vulnerabilities. After updating and refactoring the code I made sure to run the dependency check again. This will help me know if there were any new vulnerabilities. 

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

When I got stuck on what to do I usually used stackoverflow to search for answers to my questions. 

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

One assignment/project that shows my skills, knowledge, and experience is the Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report.
